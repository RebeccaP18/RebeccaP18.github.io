I randomly remembered something last night as I lay awake in my bed.

When I was in primary school, I distinctly recall deciding to spend one of my break times in the music room to practice piano. My music teacher at the time said that we were free to use the room during breaks so I took advantage of the opportunity.  
So when the bell rang for first break, I went straight to the music room and sat down at the piano.  
Not long after I started playing, I saw my music teacher head towards the door and I anticipated that he would be entering the music room soon but instead, without looking up he stood at the door for a few seconds and left again. Puzzled, I got up to go after him. When I got to the door, I realised what had happened – he had locked me in!  
I knew that it was unintentional because I had not informed him that I would be using the room but still, I went off into a mini panic. I went back to sit at the piano but I could not practice properly knowing that I was locked inside. I paced back and forth trying to decide what to do. It might seem like a small thing now, but back when I was 10 – almost any unknown situation brought me extreme anxiety.  
Eventually, I remembered that we had an intercom system and I buzzed the office to say that I was locked in. My music teacher came around and he got me out of the room, apologising to me profusely while I packed up. I left the music room just as the bell rang without having practiced a single piece.  
After school, when I repeated the story to my older cousin, she replied saying:  
“If I was you, I would have enjoyed my time in the music room and played all the instruments.”  
To this day, I feel a pang of regret for not doing just that.

What is my point in all of this?  
Sometimes, we are placed in situations by God – locked away it seems – that we did not plan for and like me, we choose to focus on the downfall of our plans instead of the opportunities that our new environment provides.  
That is exactly what I did.  
And while I thought about this story, I realised that I often do this in my own life. When things don’t go according to my plan, I become frustrated because I did not prepare for the disruption.

That day, I didn’t plan to get stuck in the music room.  
Right now, many of us didn’t plan to be stuck inside during a world-wide pandemic.  
Some of us didn&#8217;t plan to be unemployed this long.  
Some of us didn&#8217;t plan to get sick.  
Some of us didn&#8217;t plan to lose our spot in university.  
And yet here we are.

It is so easy to focus on what is not going right instead of the beauty of what we have in front of us.  
It might seem naïve of me to expect anyone to see beauty in affliction, but I want to urge you to try.

I know that it is hard to have your dreams delayed, to feel like God has locked you into a circumstance that you did not want or to feel trapped in something that you did not plan for.  
I am not just talking about feeling stuck in this pandemic but other instances of stagnation come to mind as well. Like being in a season of unemployment, or a season of singleness or a season of failure. Note that I keep saying season because it is just that – A SEASON.  
Had I just waited and enjoyed my time in the music room, practicing piano or having fun playing the other instruments, I would have left the music room more fulfilled and joyful. Instead I allowed panic and frustration to take root in my heart which ultimately blinded me to any semblance of hope.

Try your best not to do this.  
Instead look around you at the opportunities that might not be as obvious but are definitely there.  
I promise you that out of the uncertainty or solitude of whatever season you may find yourself “stuck” in, hope can grow like a flower through the cracks of concrete.  
If you feel stuck,  
Breathe and look around, you might find yourself stuck in a music room with the opportunity to play as many instruments as you want without any interruption.  
Will you choose to see being stuck as blessing or a curse?  
– the choice is yours.
