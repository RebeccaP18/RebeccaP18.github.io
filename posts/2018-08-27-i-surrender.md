The last part of this series was something that I have been thinking of for a while. For the longest time, I tried to think of what it should be. Until one day, I was brought to a point in my life where there was nothing that I could do anymore regarding my own situation. My situation had become totally overwhelming and I was at the end of my list of plans to get out of the situation. Remember the first part of this series? Well I spoke about trusting God’s plan for our lives and overcoming the fear of not knowing. This ties in with that. It was in this time that I realised that I had nothing left to give and I needed to give over FULL control to him.  
And it was during this time, that I prayed the shortest prayer I had ever prayed before.  
“God, I surrender.”  
That really was all I had to say and the beautiful thing was that He took those two words and as if He had been waiting for me to say them, flipped my perspective on EVERYTHING.  
I initially wrote so much about this subject. But I stopped myself and realised that it all boils down to this: we need to commit our spirit to God just like Jesus did.

As soon as Jesus gave up his spirit, the breakthrough came. The curtain was torn and we gained access to the holy of holies. We can apply that to everyday life. If you really want to see change in your life or if you are desperate for a difference in your circumstances, give up your will and your spirit. He might not take away the challenge but He will change your perspective.  
Jesus did not give up, He merely gave over control.  
Let’s surrender beloveds.  
God is patiently waiting for you to give up your will so that He can bring those amazing plans that He has for you to the fore.
