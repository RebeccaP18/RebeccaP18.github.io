This is not a deep or philosophical piece of writing. To be honest, I&#8217;ve been so caught up in trying to produce a great blog post somehow thinking that the word of God can&#8217;t stand by itself.  
But I was reading through my diary last night and this scripture jumped up at me. What a thought! That God is our hiding place and how true has this not been for me.  
It&#8217;s sounds a bit wrong to label God as an escape or a way out because he is so much more than that. But when I look back on my life, I realise that this is so true and I recall how many times He hid me; how many times He protected me.

**There are two ways to look at that statement:**

_**The**_ _**first being ideal**_ :  
ie. God comes through as your escape and as your safe place, which is ultimately extremely convenient for you.  
God loves us so much that He is willing to come down to our level and wait as we mumble over our small grievances, and like a mother comforts and embraces a young child, sheltering them from the outside interference that caused the pain, God in all His holiness appears and does just that. And we rejoice because the Holy Spirit has once again come in and comforted us.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

_**The second is a bit different.**_  
What about those times when you are hidden against your will? You are constantly overlooked; nobody is calling to take you out; nobody is giving you an opportunity or a platform and you start to question God and His plan for your life. Because He promised you all these things right? The same scripture applies but just from a different perspective. If anything, this perspective is more powerful because it is directly in accordance with what God has planned for your life.  
Don&#8217;t get discouraged when you feel like you are in a dark place and loneliness and doubt start to creep in.  
Don&#8217;t become pessimistic about the plan that God has for your life when things don&#8217;t seem to be working out.  
_Dark places are sometimes God&#8217;s way of protecting us._ Take it as a sign that He is hiding you and that as long as His hand is covering you, _there is still hope._

<p class="has-text-align-center">
  I love this statement that says:<br /><em><strong>Man&#8217;s rejection is God&#8217;s protection.</strong></em>
</p>

So, with all this in mind: look back over your life and I assure you that all the plans that YOU made for yourself that didn&#8217;t work out, you now see as God&#8217;s protection.  
_He was hiding you._  
**And trust me, there is no better place to be than in the protection of Yahweh.**
