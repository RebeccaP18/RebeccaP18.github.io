<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are about to enter November, and how the world has changed over the past few months. Locally, we have witnessed how the taxi industry brought the entire country to a standstill and caused many to stagnate. We trudged through many more hours of loadshedding and encountered some brutal weather conditions. Internationally, we saw the devastating realities of war in the Middle East, which left us all in disbelief. This contrasts heavily with the current mood in South Africa, with the Springboks having won the Rugby World Cup again! The cruelty of life hey &#8211; there is rich jubilation at the bottom of Africa while the Middle East is experiencing sheer agony and grief. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been a crazy year, to say the least. Boisterous, challenging, and oftentimes uncomfortable. But here we are, and what do we have to say? </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the conclusions that I have drawn about the positioning of my life right now. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is subject to change, and I may not even recognize the person that I am today in 10 years, but I do feel that this season in my life is somewhat significant, even though it may not be very obvious to others. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have realised that what the world showcases as appealing and successful is not really fulfilling. Yes, it is incredibly rewarding to accept an award and make it into a career, but when you get home that night and pack away your award, it will gather dust and maybe even rust. But hearing the words “I’m proud of you” from someone that you love and that loves you has an eternal effect on one’s soul.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have realized that there is a sacredness to keeping things hidden. Not that you are withholding admiration, but rather that you are appreciating what you have carefully &#8211; like a family heirloom that is stored in your home. Other people may not know of it’s existence, but to you, it is the most precious thing in the world. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have seen the heaviness that those who are labeled as “successful” carry, and it is not always pretty. It has not scared me away from wanting to grow, but it has made me understand, from an observer’s point of view, the sometimes burdensome responsibility that comes with power. I am grateful for the lessons that I am able to learn from others’ stories. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I have been shown how life with Jesus is one great big adventure. Having a divine encounter with the Holy Spirit is a privilege and should not be taken for granted. It is slowly sinking into me that I have the freedom to run into the arms of Love Himself. I am learning that I cannot limit God by what I see or by what is around me. God is not bound by the hindrances known to man, and therefore I need to think higher to understand Him. But to try to understand God is like trying to decipher an equation that has a solution only known to the mathematician who created it. So, instead, I am perfectly happy getting lost in my attempts to understand Him because, even in doing so, I find hidden answers to questions that I’m not even asking but am grateful to find out. How ironic! Even getting lost with God is a good thing. </span>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">So here I am, about to enter the 11th month of the year.</span>
</p>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have so much still to learn, but in a way that is exciting &#8211; because that means that God is not done with me yet. </span>

And so, the adventure continues.

Thank You, Jesus.
