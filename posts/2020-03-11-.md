I have be attempting and re-attempting to complete a blog post but it seems like everything that I want to say is coming out in the wrong way.

And so I asked myself, what has been happening in my life lately?

One thing stands out: CHANGE.

I had always been acquainted with the concept and I knew that growing up meant that it would only increase. But what I wasn&#8217;t ready for was the process surrounding it and how crazy uncomfortable it would be.

For those of us who plan religiously, change can be a rocky road.
