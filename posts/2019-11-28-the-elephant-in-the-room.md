For the longest time, I&#8217;ve wanted to write about racism and what I have experienced so far. For those of you who are turned off by that first line, don&#8217;t stop reading. Believe it or not I too was that person. In a state of blissful ignorance, I didn&#8217;t acknowledge racism as a thing. It was over &#8211; surely! We can&#8217;t still be talking about something that happened years ago (Apartheid). But it would have been a huge injustice to my people &#8211; by people I mean people of colour &#8211; to not eventually see the light; which is kind of ironic because sometimes the outlook does not look very bright at all.

I remember sitting at my late grandma&#8217;s house on one of her purple settees. Her small wendyhouse at the back of my aunty&#8217;s house was not a 5 star hotel but it was a safe space for me and it was my second home and I loved it there. It was after school and on this particular afternoon, I was so bored so I decided to quiz my ma about her life.

&#8220;Ma, where did you grow up?&#8221;  
She proceeded to tell me her life story and I was amazed at how much I did not know about her life. It was all very interesting until she came to this part.  
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been working since I was 12 years old, &#8221; &#8211; I was 12 years old at the time &#8211; &#8220;And my owner used to beat me a lot.&#8221; Her voice quivered slightly as she told me that story.  
So many things jumped out at me from just that sentence.  
_Owner? 12 years old? Working?_  
I could not fathom that my grandma, the queen of my heart, the epitome of class and dignity was subjected to that. But as I got older, I soon realised that many people of colour share a similar story.

Unbeknownst to me, that was my first encounter with an account of how the system has let us as people of colour down.

You can argue and try to reason out that racism, classism and segregation does not exist in South Africa. You have every right to do so. My suggestion to you then would be to walk around in Constantia and tell me how many people of colour live there compared to white people &#8211; and no, the cleaning ladies and handy men do not count. Then drive around for about 10 minutes until you get to Retreat and then Lavender Hill and do the same exercise there. What you&#8217;ll see are opposite sides of the spectrum, literally 10 minutes away from one another.  
Posh vs poverty, Rich vs poor, white vs black.  
These words do not taste good in my mouth as I say it but unfortunately these are the facts.

So, this is me attempting to encompass every single experience of my own along with some research and also the opinions of others, to try and make sense of the turmoil that we call racism and more importantly how it&#8217;s affecting us more than we think.
