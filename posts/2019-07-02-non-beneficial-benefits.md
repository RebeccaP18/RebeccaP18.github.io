One thing that I have learnt this year is that I still have a long list of things that I have in my life that are just there. They don’t serve a particular purpose other than to remind me of past memories.

Why do I still have these useless keepsakes?

I was recently speaking to someone and I brought up something that happened to me a while ago and as I was relaying the story, I realised that I was actually past the hurt and negativity of that experience. Why was I still telling this story if it no longer held any bearing on who I am today? Despite thinking this, I carried on telling the story.

Why?  
Because telling that story _**used to be**_ an explanation for a lot of my behaviour but if I was honest with myself, it wasn’t anymore.  
It was an unnecessary necessity.

It led me to really look at myself from a different perspective.  
And I realised that there were a lot of things in my life that didn’t necessarily harm me; but they also didn’t benefit me in any way.

The bible says in **1 Corinthians 10:23**

_“All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me but not all things edify.”_

There are many ways that you can view this scripture but in this context, we see that Apostle Paul is telling us that even though we can have all things or even though we can do all things, it doesn’t mean that they will benefit us and it doesn’t mean that it will help us.  
I believe that this counts for friendships, habits, attitudes and even thoughts.

I had to ask myself the question:<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">

_Does this still benefit me in the way that it used to?_  
_And if not, why?_

You’re not discrediting anything in your life; you’re just not going to allow yourself to use them as crutches anymore.  
You’d be surprised at how well you walk without them.
