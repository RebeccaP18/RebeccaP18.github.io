      I never really saw myself as “single” until my 14 year old cousin asked me. “Why are you still single?”<br />And as I proceeded to answer her, trying to figure out how being single was actually a thing, I quickly whipped up an answer and told her,<br />“There’s nobody in my life that I want to be in a relationship with and I kinda enjoy being single.”<br />

That last part must’ve shocked her because she looked at me in disgust as if to say, _“Why would anyone CHOOSE to be single?”_  
That was a while back and I still think back to it with a smile on my face.

In the social climate that we find ourselves in, relationships and “love” are over-advertised and somewhat under-valued. Being in a relationship is seen as an achievement and eliminates the possibility of you being “alone.”

With social media incessantly emphasising the need to find love and to have a significant other, it causes society to frown upon those who choose not to indulge in those things prematurely.  
And it doesn’t necessarily mean that the latter group of people don’t desire love; it just means that they are single and secure.

I believe that being single and secure means that you are focused on yourself and building up your foundation more than on the prospect of someone else.

Your actions are geared towards bettering YOU and not necessarily to impress another person.

Should someone come along and he/she is NOT a fit, you move on with the knowledge that you are worth more. _Secure people never settle just for a title._

Being single and secure does NOT mean that you do not feel. You’re human and you do have a heart; but you also know that your heart can be deceitful and so you pray before you decide.

Being single and secure is also not easy because you may come across as strong and unbothered but it does ting a bit when someone does not answer a text or you get ignored or you see all your friends finding love; the only difference between a secure single person and an insecure single person is that you don’t act on your emotions – you wait on God.

What I’m really trying to say is that, being single is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s probably when you’re the most free. I’ve made the decision to use this time that I have as someone single, to the fullest.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">

    <em>“To everything there is a season, A time for every purpose under heaven….”</em>
  </p>
  
  <cite><strong>Eccleciastes 3:1</strong></cite>
</blockquote>

Don’t waste this season of being single because you’re waiting for another season.  
Instead embrace this time and you might find yourself flourishing without the things you thought you needed.
