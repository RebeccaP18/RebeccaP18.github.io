I recently went to a ladies high tea afternoon aimed at young teenage girls. As I sat there, a myriad of memories and lessons came flooding through my mind. Back when I was a teenager, I had no idea what I was doing and when I looked at other women who were in their 20&#8217;s, I thought that they had it all figured it. But knowing what I know now, I know that they were far from perfect. Looking back, there are some things that I wish someone told me and I thought that I would share them with you.<figure></figure> 

Here are some lessons that I&#8217;ve learned in my walk with Christ.

**1. Spend as much time with the Lord as possible while you are young**

With social media, Netflix, online platforms etc, there are many opportunities for the enemy to steal our attention. But I want to urge you to spend time with God. Read your word, pray, write letters to God, watch or participate in Biblical discussions, listen to worship music, go on a walk or run and talk to God. DO NOT think that you are wasting your time &#8211; those moments are precious and sacred. As you get older, your time becomes more restricted because you have more responsibilities. I&#8217;m not saying that you cannot make time for God when you are older, but I am saying that the time that you have when you are young is so valuable.

**Matthew 6:33**

_&#8220;But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.&#8221;_

**2. Your relationship with God does not have to look like someone else&#8217;s**

When I started praying, I thought that my prayers had to sound like my mom&#8217;s prayers. And when they didn&#8217;t, I thought that I was disappointing God. I wasted waaaay too much time trying to be someone else when I could have used that time to authentically grow into the woman that God wanted me to be. Again, there is nothing wrong with having a mentor or role model to show you the way but when you start becoming inauthentic and merely a copy cat, you are losing what it means to have a relationship with God.

**Philippians 2:12-13 ESV**

_&#8220;Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.&#8221;_

**3. Understand the Gospel.** 

Man, this is a big one. I feel as though I spent a large part of my spiritual journey as a a fraud because I did not understand the Gospel. Oh, I knew that God is great and that we have the Holy Spirit etc. But I did not understand the essence of the Gospel. I recited John 3:16 like a pro without realising what it meant. Make it your mission to understand the Gospel. Know that the Holy scriptures are not to appease us but rather that they all interlink as part of God&#8217;s grand design to glorify Christ.

**(See Romans 8:1-4)**

**4. Your circle is important**

When you are young, your life is deeply affected by the relationships around you. I remember being part of a group that came on my path at just the right time and in that group I was encouraged to spend more time with God, to pray, to fast and worship. It did wonders for my walk with Christ and I felt as though I was not alone. Your circle of friends can either build you up spiritually or break you down spiritually so make it an earnest prayer of yours that God sends you the right friends. If you feel as though you do not have the right friend group, lean more on Christ. He is honestly the best friend and will send you the right people in due time.

**Proverbs 13:20**

_&#8220;20 Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.&#8221;_

**5. In case nobody told you, life with Jesus is an adventure**

For the longest time, I had it in my mind that serving God was stiff, traditional and based off of duty. Later on, I realised how rewarding and fulfilling serving God is. When this happened, I immediately thought that I was doing something wrong (lol). I felt as though because I&#8217;m enjoying life with God, I am not doing it right. I felt this way because nobody had really ever shown me that serving God can be fun and enjoyable and full. Yes, it is not easy but it is also not dull and dreary. There is so much more locked in God that He shows you periodically and you find yourself saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I get to serve You, God.&#8221; I have many stories of how God showed up for me in ways that only He can. So many &#8216;God-winks&#8217;, so many chuckles in my quiet time and such deep, pure love. Man, say yes to God and He will come in and completely change it for good. I hope that you say yes to a life of adventure with God.

**1 Corinthians 2:9**

_&#8220;9 But as it is written:_

_Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,_

_Nor have entered into the heart of man_

_The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”_
