One thing that the quarantine of 2020 has taught me is that there is so much beauty in being still.  
As someone who thrives on being busy, I used to avoid being quiet (I still do somewhat). So much so that it filtered over into my faith &#8211; not giving a chance for the Holy Spirit to talk to me; in relationships &#8211; trying to fill up ever awkward silence with words.

But as I have grown, I have realised that silence is not a bad thing.  
In fact, it is necessary.

Mozart said,  
_&#8220;The music is not in the notes, but in the **silence** in between.&#8221;_

When I heard that statement the other day, it moved me tremendously and left me &#8211; pardon the irony &#8211; speechless. Because if you think about it, that makes so much sense. One cannot live in constant noise because it will become unbearable; in the same way, we can not keep making moves and working and talking and building etc without a break, without some quiet, without some time for consolidation.  
Why?  
The silence makes us appreciate the victories.  
The silence makes us take in the music.  
The silence gives us a chance to breathe.

Yes, of course silence can be frustrating at times but I promise you, that if we switch our perspective, it may be the best season or moment of our lives.  
So, be thankful for the silence.  
And use it effectively.  
Because it can be just as loud and melodious as a symphony, if you listen properly.
