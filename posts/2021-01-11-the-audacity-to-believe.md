I&#8217;ll never forget the moment I realised that my dad was crazy.  
I went up to him and told him what had happened; what the university told me and that there&#8217;s nothing that I could do.  
I remember feeling so defeated.  
&#8220;Daddy, they aren&#8217;t going to take me back. They said that I should look at other options.&#8221;  
I showed him the letters that they sent.  
He looked at me and said,  
&#8220;Becky, I believe that God will make a way. You mustn&#8217;t give up. Even if they say that it&#8217;s over &#8211; I don&#8217;t believe that. We must have faith.&#8221;  
I looked at him in disbelief, thinking  
&#8220;This man really has the audacity to believe despite the evidence that I presented.&#8221;

All my life, my dad has been that beacon of faith for me &#8211; pushing me to always choose to believe despite the evidence.  
To have the audacity to believe.

That is the purpose of this blog post.  
I want to challenge you and myself this week to have the audacity to believe.

Jesus was asked to heal a centurion&#8221;s servant and what the centurion said made Jesus &#8220;marvel&#8221; at him.  
He said, &#8220;Jesus if you just SAY THE WORD my servant will be healed.&#8221;  
Man, he didn&#8217;t even want Jesus to come in to his home; he just wanted him to _say a word. (Luke 7:1-10)_

How many of us have that kind of faith?  
I want Jesus to marvel at my faith.  
I want Him to stand back and say, &#8220;I have never seen faith like that before. &#8220;  
Imagine that?

And to be honest, I need faith like that.  
At least for today, I want to have the audacity to believe.  
Despite the evidence, despite the challenges, despite the facts.  
I will have the audacity to believe.  
Let&#8217;s do this!

P.S my dad was right. The university allowed me to come back.
