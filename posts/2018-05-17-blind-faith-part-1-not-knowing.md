I have been told that some of my posts are waaaay too long, so I&#8217;ve decided to separate them into parts to accommodate everyone.  
This series that I&#8217;m working on is very personal and something that is kinda like a faith project because I am encouraging myself as I encourage you. I pray that you are blessed by this and that it speaks to your heart.

## Part 1: The fear of not knowing {.wp-block-heading}

I don&#8217;t know if anybody else can relate but I have a fear of the unknown. Not knowing what is going to happen next scares me so much which is ironic because being certain of something doesn&#8217;t really fit in with the idea of spiritual faith. There have been so many occurrences especially in my first two years of varsity where I have just not known how to go about my next move.  
We can so easily quote that scripture, &#8220;_We walk by faith and not by sight,_&#8220;(2 Cor. 5:7). But to be honest, we say that while we can still kinda see our own way; so we&#8217;re not really being put to the test of faith.

For those of us who have gone through things where you literally felt like you were walking blindly and you had no idea how you were going to make it through _because you couldn&#8217;t even see the way out_ &#8211; this is for you.

Just look at that previous sentence though: &#8220;YOU&#8221; couldn&#8217;t see a way out. That&#8217;s a mistake that I always seem to make. I make so many plans and work out so many things in my head, up to plan Z. And then when I reach that point where none of my plans have worked out and I have concluded that there is no way out, despondency sets in and NOW I start questioning God. Gosh, so many &#8216;I&#8217;s and &#8216;my&#8217;s&#8217;. So much of myself and so little of Him.  
You see, we think that we think that everything needs to make sense. We think that life is filled with carefully worked out formula&#8217;s and steps (at least I do). But it&#8217;s not &#8211; faith does not make sense. It is not something that will fit in with your mind&#8217;s ideas. And there are many days where you will not know what to do. I cannot count the amount of times where I have told God, &#8220;God, I just don&#8217;t know.&#8221; It&#8217;s a scary and uncomfortable position to be in but if you listen close enough, you will hear Him softly whisper, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry; because I know.&#8221;  
Those two words should be enough to take you through, &#8220;He knows.&#8221; Jeremiah 29:11 says, _&#8220;For I KNOW the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you._

So if you still don&#8217;t know, rest assured that He knows and as he promised &#8211; He will never leave you nor forsake you.  
Because He knows, not knowing is not going to kill me; not knowing is only going to grow my faith.  
I have concluded that the only thing that I really need to know is that He knows and more than that, He&#8217;s got me.

And for now, that&#8217;s all I really need.
