&#8220;I am not where I want to be!&#8221;  
&#8220;I don&#8217;t have all that I want.&#8221;  
&#8220;Everything is not okay&#8221;

These are a few of the phrases that I found myself uttering a while ago. It crept in slowly but surely until I found myself incredibly down-hearted. Like any negative vibe, it starts small but quickly manifests itself everywhere, and like a germ it spreads. I inquired of God as to why my heart felt so heavy and He took me back to that day when I stood before the vending machine and I did not have enough money to buy what I wanted.

&#8220;If I had more money, I wouldn&#8217;t have to count every penny!&#8221; I said under my breath and turned away in a huff.  
And I realized that my attitude was totally contradictory to that of a child of God. We are victorious just because. Not because of our possessions, not because of what we own but because we are heirs of God along with Jesus.<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">

Our words and thoughts carry more power than we think. What we speak over ourselves can be manifested in reality. You wander why you can&#8217;t lose weight, what do you keep telling yourself when you try to work out? Is it positive or negative? You wander why you can&#8217;t pass a certain subject? What are you telling yourself whenever you enter that specific class? Are you filled with dread or do try your best to enjoy it. There is beauty in everything even something painful, but it is only found by those who willing to search for it.

A goal for me this week is to replace every, &#8220;I am broke&#8221; with &#8220;I am blessed!&#8217;; every, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this&#8221; with, &#8220;I can do all things through Christ.&#8221; and every, &#8220;I am not good enough,&#8221; with, &#8220;I am more than enough.&#8221;

If like me, you have found yourself downhearted, try and think of the words that you have spoken over yourself. Try to determine whether they release good vibes or bad vibes, and then make adjustments accordingly.

Be encouraged loved ones! God is always incredibly good.  
Just like this psalmist, motivate yourself,

**Psalm 42:5**  
_5 Why, my soul, are you downcast?_

_Why so disturbed within me?_

_Put your hope in God,_

_for I will yet praise him,_

_my Savior and my God._
