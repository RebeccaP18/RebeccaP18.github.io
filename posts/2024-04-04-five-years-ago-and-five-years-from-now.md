I got to the circle where you exit the beach area and thought back to approximately 5 years prior and how I struggled to navigate the incline at that circle. I was n</span>ot yet 100% comfortable with driving, and I was so nervous on the roads. But now, I can do it with ease. It made me realize that oftentimes difficult situations seem more difficult because they are wrapped in unfamiliarity and uncertainty. The obstacle seems unbearable because you’ve never carried it before.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I easily navigated around that circle and drove home. Life has a funny way of teaching you lessons in seemingly mundane things. Like a flower blossoming through a crack in the pavement, it dawned on me: 5 years from now, the obstacles in front of me won’t be unbearable. In time, I will learn to carry it, and in time, I will move past it. Right now, the challenge seems overwhelming, but one day, I will look back and smile at my naivete and fear because, in 5 years, my questions will be answered, and these struggles will be so far in my rearview mirror that I’ll struggle to see them. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">5 years ago, I faced things that seemed so hard at the time, but now I use those lessons as emblems of God’s goodness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">5 years from now, all the struggles that I am currently facing will not be as overwhelming as they now seem. I’ll speak about this time with a peculiar sense of gratitude and, finally, some understanding. Even though it doesn’t seem that way now, 5 years from now, everything will make sense. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All it takes is time.</span>

_&#8220;No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.&#8221; **1 Corinthians 10:13. **_
