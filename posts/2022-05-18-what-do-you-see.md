I remember a time when I was confronted with many decisions at once.  
Long story short, I failed my first year of university, lost my bursary and my place at university.  
At the time, I was so lost and I felt like my dream was slipping away.  
If you had asked me the question: **&#8220;What do you see?&#8221;** back then, I would have told you, _&#8220;I see an impossible situation.&#8221;_

Over the years, God has grown my faith and even though I am still prone to doubt, I have learned that trusting God, is far better than trusting man or this world. I learned a lot of tough lessons during my undergrad years but one of them was how to **fix my vision**. I struggled with doubt a lot (and still do) because I viewed every obstacle from a realistic point of view. I examined the facts and acted accordingly. Faith in God was often given a back seat. But then through people and prayer, God began to tell me things that was contrary to the facts and I was posed with a question:  
_**Do I go with what I see or do I go with what He told me?**_

As with many situations in our lives, our perspective can make or break how we come out of that situation.  
It&#8217;s similar in your walk with God.  
Many of us have adopted the viewpoint that the world has imposed on us. Which is not wrong, in fact, it is often our natural response. When we see obstacles, we are not immediately filled with joy or excitement. It is rather a mixture of anxiety, frustration and fear.

But what if God is calling us higher?  
What if He has called us to adopt His perspective?

**Psalm 121** gives us a different perspective.  
It says,

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    <em>&#8220;I will lift up my eyes to the hills &#8211; From whence comes my help? </em><br /><em>My <strong>help</strong> comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth.&#8221; </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

Where you see a mountain or a hill as an obstacle, God see&#8217;s it as an opportunity to help you.  
But we cannot see that because our perspective that the mountain is a stumbling block, blinds us to God&#8217;s promise. The Holy Spirit is there to help you get through whatever obstacle you face but you need to fix your vision. Faith often doesn&#8217;t make sense but perhaps we aren&#8217;t called to understand but rather to trust; trust that He will do what He said.

So the next time you are faced with a seemingly impossible situation, instead of viewing it as an overwhelming obstacle, adopt God&#8217;s vision and see it as an opportunity for God to show you His glory.  
Maybe this time, when you are asked (like me),  
**_&#8220;What do you see?&#8221;_**  
Your answer will be a doorway for miracles.

**<u>Mark 11:22-24</u>**

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    <em><strong>&#8220;22 “Have faith in God,” Jesus answered. 23 “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. 24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&#8221;</strong></em>
