Call it a season of singleness, call it a season of solitude. Call it being alone, call it being without somebody. Call it freedom, call it learning how to love yourself.



Call it whatever you want.  
I&#8217;ve heard them all.

But don&#8217;t negate the importance and value of this season.  
Romance is a beautiful thing to experience but learning how to find the romance in every day is a skill that is not talked about enough.

I am tired of the masses over-emphasizing romantic relationships and under-emphasizing the time when you are not tied to another.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I am **by no means** against love especially the love between a man and woman. I too, want a husband and a family of my own one day. But I have found great significance and value in the season that I am in and so I have decided to take it for what it is and to drench myself in every lesson that the Holy Spirit wants to teach me. My desire is that when the man that God has for me comes, I will have wrung out every experience, task and goal that this season can afford me. Or at least come close to that.

As for romance, reading God&#8217;s word and seeing it come to life, waking up to see the sunrise with a hot cup of coffee, watching the waves ebb and flow as I listen to Camille Saint Saens &#8220;The Swan&#8221; or The Doxology; seeing the light hit the water and feeling the crisp autumn breeze against my cheek; Seeing the trees sway, the mountains stand resolute, while the sun tries to find it&#8217;s way through the darkness &#8211; seeing all this displayed at no cost to me fills me with such immense joy; because it is as if God Himself, is moving through every action that nature displays. And I have a front row seat to that; as if it was a performance, a gift presented just for me.  
**Why, that in and of itself is a _glorious romance._**  
**A love letter written by God to me.**

So, no I am not anti-men or relationships. I am 100% for it and I am so happy for you if you have found someone to love and who loves you back. I know that at the right time God will make it happen for me.  
But at the same time, I am also not anti-_&#8220;being alone&#8221;_.  
For I am not ever actually alone.  
The One who loves me the most walks with me always, with an invitation to the grandest love that I will ever experience.



**<u>Ecclesiastes 3:11</u>**

_&#8220;11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart&#8230;&#8221;_
