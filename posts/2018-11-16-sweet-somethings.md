Sweet nothings

_“Words of affection exchanged by lovers”_

I’ve often compared my relationship to God as a relationship that you would have with a significant other – a girlfriend, a boyfriend. Some people might find it strange, but in many ways – it is definitely just like that.

Lately, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how the shouts of the world are becoming so loud these days. It can get pretty overwhelming sometimes to the point where you really struggle to hear God’s voice. I mean, it’s really challenging to press into the peace of Christ with the weight of the world reverberating on your shoulder. I was reminded of the scripture in **1 Kings 19:1-18** where Elijah finds himself in a difficult position – fleeing for his life from Jezebel and alone in a desert. In **verse 4**, he is literally so brutally honest with God and tells God straight, “I have had enough, Lord.” Have any of you ever been in that position before? Caught between a rock and a hard place, tired, weary and at your wits end? I have and it’s in those times that it’s REALLY difficult to hear God’s voice.  
Later on in the scripture, the Lord says “Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass by.”  
Long story short, a strong wind blows by, followed by an earthquake, followed by fire – however, God is not in any of those things instead He presents Himself to Elijah in a soft whisper.

Coming back to being in relationship with God, this is what the Holy Spirit showed me – when you’re in a relationship with someone else, it is very normal to cuddle up alongside that person and have them whisper sweet-nothings into your ear. Nobody else hears the dialogue that is going on between the two of you – it is personal and intimate. Now in the same way, Christ is whispering to us. According to this portion of scripture, He does not often come in the way that we might expect – loud, aggressive and overwhelming. He definitely can speak to us like that but a relationship requires intimacy and so in order to hear, Christ’s whisper, we need GET CLOSER TO HIM and have our ears pointed in His direction.

Have you ever considered that perhaps the reason why you’re not hearing God is because you aren’t close to Him? Christ wants to converse with you and share **_“sweet-somethings”_** with you, but He’ll only move closer to you once you choose to move closer to Him.
