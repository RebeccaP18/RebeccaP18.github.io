Here’s a wild thought that the Holy Spirit dropped in my spirit while I was jogging with my brother. I was becoming tired as I ran and as I looked around, I was becoming dismayed because I saw that I had not come far and that I still had far to go and I was already tired. Then I did something that made the run a bit better: I put my head down. Doing this prevented me from seeing what was going on around me. As this was happening, the Holy Spirit immediately reminded me of this series that I’m busy with and He reminded me of the title, “BLIND faith.”

Sometimes we have to become blind in order to complete the race. It reminds me of that song, **“Turn your eyes upon Jesus; look full in His wonderful face and the things of this will grow strangely dim in the light of His glory and grace.”** So simple and yet so powerful; _the things of this world will grow strangely dim._ Sometimes we become so distracted by what is happening around us and that doesn’t benefit us at all; it just makes us TIRED.

**Galatians 5** is such a powerful chapter in the new testament and it talks about the freedom found in Christ. I urge you to go and read it yourself when you get the opportunity. One portion though, that struck a chord with me was verses 7-8.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    <em>“You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth? (8) That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.”</em>
  </p>
  
  <cite><strong>Galatians 5:7-8</strong></cite>
</blockquote>

Wow! Isn’t this the trap that so many of us fall into? I know that I have. Apostle Paul says here, “Who cut in on you…?” And sometimes, we see people passing us in life’s race and jealousy and doubt sets in. Why? Because we’re comparing our journey to theirs’ when it’s not meant to be the same! Do not allow somebody else to diminish your progress. It’s not a sprint; it’s a race of perseverance.

The bottom line is this: Comparison is just robbing you of your faith. I urge you to make the decision today.  
Am I going to focus on my race and my coach? Or am I going to continue to look around at things that do not concern me?

The next time we see someone else in another new relationship after we’ve been single for the longest time, say to yourself – That’s not my race; my race is preparing me for greater.

When you see someone else succeeding and achieving something that you have been working for yourself, tell yourself – that’s not my race; my race is preparing me for better.

Lastly, remember **Hebrews 10:36**  
“You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised.”
