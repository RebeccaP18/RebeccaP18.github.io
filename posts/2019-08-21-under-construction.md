Close to my campus, they are busy with heavy construction. Now, they’ve been busy with construction for a while now but recently as I was watching the workers and the progress, I realised that I could see myself in the bricks and mortar; in the cranes lifting equipment to higher floors even in the bulldozers knocking down old walls. I saw my current circumstance as the images displayed before me and just like the huge sign standing in front of the site, the title of my current season shone clearly: UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

**What does it mean to be under construction?**

I don’t know much about construction but I can guess that just like the building being renovated, the first step is to get rid of the old, broken and useless parts. And this might just be the most difficult part. You may have gotten so used to a certain routine, to certain people, to a certain environment etc but the next stage of your life requires an upgrade and you can not fully excel in that next level while still holding onto the old. Sometimes it’s a gentle peel down of wallpaper – not too excruciating but simultaneously time-consuming or it could be the bulldozing of a wall – quick but messy. Either way, you’re doing away with something you were once accustomed to and for a second you will be exposed.

In life, it’s similar and it’s easier said than done. But there is something to look forward to: A CLEAN SLATE. There’s nothing more exciting than knowing that the possibilities are endless for the new chapter that you’re about to enter. Yes, it is daunting and trust me, as someone who does not enjoy change, it can be scary. But there can not be progress without a little discomfort. As I’m getting older, I’m learning that ignorance is sometimes the biggest thief of elevation – in other words when we limit ourselves to what we’ve always known, not daring to enter into new discussions or rooms, we hinder ourselves of becoming better. And in order to become better, a good clean-up is needed.

So do not be discouraged when it seems like the “old faithfuls” that used to hold you up, start falling away. That’s God making way for the new. Yes, you may stumble a bit and lose your footing here and there, but rest assured you’ll find yourself running this race _just fine_, without all the things you thought that you needed.

I want to encourage everyone who finds themselves in this  
stage of their construction (including myself) to keep their heads up.  
We’re being built up for something better.  
We may not see it now but God does.  
And as long as I know that He is building me, I’ll trust His plan for me.
